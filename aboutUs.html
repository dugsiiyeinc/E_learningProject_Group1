          <p>
            When we started LearnOnline Courses back in 2018, our goal was to
            give Somalis from all across the world the ability to learn the
            skills they’d need to succeed in this modern century. We set out to
            create a new, interactive way of learning — making it engaging,
            flexible, and accessible for as many people as possible. Since then,
            we have helped hundreds of Somali people worldwide unlock modern
            technical skills and reach their full potential through code. There
            are two commitments we've made to the world. We've been grounded by
            these since day one: Increase access to high-quality education for
            everyone, everywhere; Enhance teaching and learning online through
            research.
          </p>

          <h3 class="about-goals">Our Vision</h3>
          <p>
            To reach out to all Somali communities through knowledge and to be a
            comprehensive online institute that offers quality-oriented
            education and accredited certification.
          </p>
          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            We want to create a world where anyone can build something
            meaningful with technology, and everyone has the learning tools,
            resources, and opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of
            possibilities — all that’s required is the curiosity and drive to
            learn. At LearnOnline, we are dedicated to empowering all people,
            regardless of where they are in their coding journeys, to continue
            to learn, grow, and make an impact on the world around them.
